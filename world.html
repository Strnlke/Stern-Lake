            Stern Lake, Ohio—a town unlike any other. Owned by Stargazers United, it exists as both a community and a spectacle, a place where the boundaries between public space and corporate property blur. Every Tuesday, I dive deeper into the locations, history, and hidden layers of this unique setting.

                    Stern Lake isn't empty, but it isn't full either. The houses have trimmed lawns and tinted windows, and many driveways sit unused. The town looks maintained, even when it feels quiet. When Stern Lake first opened in 2013, people arrived quickly. Within a year, there were few places left to live. Many residents worked for the same company that owned their homes, and the town moved at a steady, communal pace. That rhythm didn't last. Now, the spaces meant for neighbors have been replaced with spaces meant for visitors. Toy stores, learning centers, and a school designed more for demonstration than community line the streets. They keep the town active, even when fewer people stay. Stern Lake didn't empty out. It reorganized. What was once built for residents now exists for an audience.

                    On the east side of town, a freshly washed concrete slab, marks where the town's church once stood—a building lost when grief turned to anger. The congregation, once a community built of trust, became victims in the aftermath—crushed between tragedy and scandal. When two teenage kid's deaths led to the church destruction, a scar was left on both the land and the people. Now the slab stands as a canvas for many who felt abandoned to keep the memory alive as a silent but loud reminder. In Stern lake, even what's lost still shapes what remains. But what else does this foundation reveal about the past? Stay tuned as we uncover more of Stern Lake's hidden layers.

                    Stern Lake isn't a typical town. While it may look like a community, it's actually more like private property, fully owned and controlled by Stargazers United. It has residents, of course, but many houses remain empty, giving parts of the town a stage-like quality. The real turning point came when Stargazers United introduced educational programs and tours to gain the trust of the people after some turned away. That's when Stern Lake shifted into more of a showcase—a "billboard town" for space exploration and the central hub of Stargazers United's public image. It became a place created to be seen, where the focus was on presenting an idealized version of Stargazers United. But when the focus shifts away from genuine teaching and more toward showcasing a company's image, the essence of community starts to fade...
